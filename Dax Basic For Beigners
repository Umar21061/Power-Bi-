DAX Formulas:
•	   DAX formulas are used to create custom calculations in Power BI.
•	   Formulas are written in a formula bar and can reference columns, tables, and other DAX functions.
Common DAX Functions:
•	   Mathematical Functions:
  SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, etc.

•	   Statistical Functions:

   COUNTROWS, SUMX, AVERAGEX, etc.
•	   Text Functions:

  LEFT, RIGHT, CONCATENATE, etc.

•	   Date and Time Functions:

  TODAY, NOW, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, etc.

•	   Filter Functions:

    FILTER, ALL, ALLEXCEPT, RELATED, etc.

•	Logical Functions:

   IF, AND, OR, NOT, etc.

Calculated Columns:
   •	Calculated columns are used to add new columns to a table based on a DAX formula.
   •	These columns are calculated row by row at the time of data refresh.

Measures:
   •	Measures are used for creating aggregations or calculations based on the data in the model.
   •	Unlike calculated columns, measures are not stored in the data model but are calculated on the fly.

Row Context and Filter Context:
     Understanding context is crucial in DAX.
   • Row Context:
      Refers to the current row of the table in which the formula is being evaluated.
   • Filter Context:
     Refers to the set of filters that are applied to the data before the formula is evaluated.

Relationships:
   •	 Relationships define how tables are related to each other.
   •	 Relationships are established based on common columns between tables.


Time Intelligence:
    •	 DAX has specialized functions for time-based calculations, such as TOTALYTD, TOTALQTD, TOTALMTD, etc.

Variables:
    •	Variables allow you to store intermediate results in a formula, making it more readable and efficient.

Error Handling:
     •	DAX provides functions like `IFERROR` and `ISERROR` for error handling in formulas.

Context Transition:
     •	DAX can transition between row context and filter context, and understanding this is essential for writing complex formulas.
