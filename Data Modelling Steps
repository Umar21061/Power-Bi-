•	 It allows you to create calculated columns, measures, and calculated tables to derive new information from existing data.

5. Measures and Calculations:
•	Measures are dynamic calculations based on the data in your model. They are often used in creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business metrics.
•	Calculated columns are columns you create based on a formula that operates on the row context of the table.

6. Visualizations:
•	 Power BI offers a wide range of visualization options, including charts, tables, maps, and more.
•	 You can create dashboards that combine multiple visualizations to tell a comprehensive data story.

7. Row-level Security:
•	Power BI allows you to implement row-level security to control data access at the row level based on user roles and filters.

8. Data Refresh:
•	 Power BI enables you to schedule automatic data refresh to keep your reports up-to-date with the latest information from your data sources.

9. Publishing and Sharing:
•	Once your model and reports are ready, you can publish them to the Power BI service for sharing with others.
•	 Power BI service provides collaboration features and allows you to create and share dashboards.

10. Power BI Service:
•	The Power BI service is the cloud-based platform where you can host, share, and collaborate on Power BI reports and dashboards.
