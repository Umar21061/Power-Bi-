1. Data Sources:
•	Power BI can connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL), cloud-based services (Azure, Salesforce, Google Analytics), on-premises data,
Excel files, web services, and more.

2. Power Query:
•	Power Query is the data transformation and data loading component of Power BI. It allows you to connect to various data sources, transform and shape data using a graphical interface, 
and load it into the data model.

3. Data Model:
•	   The data model is the heart of Power BI and consists of tables, relationships, calculated columns, and measures. Power BI uses an in-memory data engine to store
and manage the data model efficiently.

4. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX):
•	   DAX is a formula language used to create custom calculations, measures, and calculated columns within the data model. It provides advanced capabilities for data analysis
and modeling.

5. Report Layout:
•	    In Power BI Desktop, you design the layout of your reports and dashboards. This includes selecting visuals (charts, tables, maps, etc.), arranging them on pages,
and defining interactivity.

6. Visualizations:
•	    Power BI offers a rich library of pre-built data visualizations, and you can also integrate custom visuals from the marketplace. Visualizations allow you to
represent data in a visually compelling and interactive manner.

7. Power BI Desktop:
•	    Power BI Desktop is the Windows application used for creating and designing reports and dashboards. It's where you build the data model, create visuals, 
and define report layouts.

8. Publishing:
•	    After creating reports in Power BI Desktop, you can publish them to the Power BI Service. The publishing process makes your reports available in the 
cloud for sharing and collaboration.

9. Power BI Service:
•	    Power BI Service is the cloud-based platform where you can publish, share, and collaborate on reports and dashboards. It offers features like automatic data refresh, 
sharing with others, and dashboard creation.

10. Data Gateways:
•	     Power BI allows you to connect to on-premises data sources using data gateways. These gateways establish secure connections between the cloud-based Power BI
Service and on-premises data.

11. Row-Level Security:
•	     Power BI enables you to implement row-level security to restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.

12. Mobile Apps:
•	     Power BI provides mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, allowing users to access and interact with reports and dashboards on the go.

13. APIs and Embedding:
•	     Power BI offers APIs that allow developers to integrate and embed Power BI reports and dashboards into custom applications, websites, and portals.

14. Dataflow and Data Warehouse Integration:
•	    Power BI supports dataflows for data preparation and transformation. It can also integrate with data warehouses and big data platforms
for more extensive data processing and analysis.
